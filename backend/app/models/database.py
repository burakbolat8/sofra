# Simplified database model - we don't need complex recipe storage anymore
# The app now uses a simple static list of Turkish meals

# Database configuration (kept for potential future use)
DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./sofra_meals.db"

# For now, we'll use the static Turkish meals list
# If needed in the future, we can add a simple meal storage here
